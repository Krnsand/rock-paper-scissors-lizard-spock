# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This is the classic game of Rock, paper, scissors but with a fun twist! Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is the version of the game that the characters from The Big Bang Theory plays. While the old rules still applies, there are two new playable options that take the game to a new level! Click the link below to try it yourself!

## Features 

I wanted my game to be easy to play and to understand, that is why the rules are posted at the bottom of the page so that one can easily check to see which option does what.

### Existing Features

- __Header__

  - The header makes it clear what game one is playing if one was to forget anytime during the game.

- __Moves Left__

  - This function shows the player how many moves one has left during the game as it counts down with every click to finaly stop at 0.  
  - It can be fun for the player to see how many moves make up one game so that it does not come as a surprise when the game is over.

- __The Controls__

  - Here the player can see what options one can choose from to play. 
  - Underneath the player options one will find the "reset button" that resets the game after it is over. It will reset the game wherever in the game the player might find themselves in, but what is the fun in that?

- __The Game Area__ 

  - In the game area one can see an image of the option one chooses to play. This creates an interactive experience which can enhance the user experience.
  - Here one can also see the scores being counted at the top of each image.

- __Who Won__

  - Here the player gets a message saying who won the game. 
  - It shows up right underneath the reset button which makes it easy to restart the game and play again.

- __The Footer__

  - In the footer the player can read the rules of the game. As there are many more than in the classic rock, paper, scissors game, the rules are visable at all times during the game.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add a multiplayer feature in the future, where two players can play against each other.
- I would like to add some sound effects to the "Who Won" message.

## Testing 

I have tested my code throughout the project as I wanted to check regularly that I was not making mistakes. I have run my HTML through:

- The W3C Markup Validation Service: 

  <details><summary>Index</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/blob/main/assets/images/readme_images/index_check.png">
  </details>

I have run my CSS through: 

- The W3C CSS Validation Service:

  <details><summary>CSS</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/blob/main/assets/images/readme_images/css_check.png">
  </details>

And I have run my JavaScript through: 

- The JSHint website:

  <details><summary>JavaScript</summary>
  <img src="">
  </details>

- I have successfully tested my website on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet Browser.
- I have used Google Chrome Developer Tools throughout the creation of my project to test layouts and responsivness as I progressed.
- I have used Google Chrome Developer Tools to test on following devices:
  - iPhone SE
  - iPhone XR
  - iPhone 12 PRO
  - Pixel 5
  - Samsung Galaxy S8+
  - Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
  - iPad Air
  - iPad Mini
  - Surface Pro 7
  - Surface Duo
  - Galaxy Fold
  - Samsung Galaxy A51/71
  - Nest Hub
  - Nest Hub Max

I tested my deployed website with Lighthouse and got the following results:

<details><summary>Home</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/index_lighthouse.png">
  </details>

I believe my performance score was effected by the sizes of my images. I will look into how to better the performance score in the future.

### Unfixed Bugs

- A bug I noticed was that sometimes, after having had Google Chrome Developer Tools open for a while, the website looked like this when developer Tools was closed:

<details><summary>Bug image</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/bug.png">
</details>
<details><summary>Bug image</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/bug1.png">
</details>

It was as if DevTools was still open and set to a certain device screen-size even after it had been closed. If I went to another tab and then returned to my website, the layout had fixed itself, always. I don't understand it and I don't know what to do about it. I will look into it in the future. 

- Another bug (or an interesting special feature perhaps) I found was that some of my style to the Home page did not show up as intended on my own phone. The reason being I have it on "dark mode". Personally I don't mind this "bug" as it doesn't make anything hard to read or messes with the layout or anything else. It just doesn't look as intended. I will look into why it does this in the future, but for now I am enjoying the special effects.

## Deployment

- My website was deployed to GitHub pages. The following steps were used: 
  - In the Github repository of the project find and click the <em>settings</em> symbol  
  - On the left hand side there is a menu, find and click <em>Pages</em>
  - Choose the <em>main</em> branch from the <em>none</em> drop down menu and click save
  - The link to the website needs a couple of minutes to load, then refresh the page and the link will show up at the top of the <em>Pages</em> section with the text "Your site is live at https://krnsand.github.io/portfolio1_plant_care/"
