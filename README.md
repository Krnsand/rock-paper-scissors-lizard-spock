This is the classic game of Rock, paper, scissors but with a fun twist! Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is the version of that game that the characters from The Big Bang Theory plays. While the old rules applies, the lizard and Spock

## Features 

I wanted my website to be easy to navigate with clear and visible features that would make the user experience into a good one to encourage people to return to it. 

My website is for anyone wanting to learn more about how to care for their plants, wether they are beginners just trying to keep their plants alive, or more seasoned hobbyists who are looking for more specific tips regarding a certain type of plant.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, Care Station and Newsletter sign up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

  - The home page includes a photograph relevant to the webpage with text on the side to make it clear to the user what page of the site they are on.

- __The Sign Up Page__

  - This page will allow the user to get signed up to the Newsletter the website offers in order to get regular tips and tricks regarding their plants as well as inspiration for what to do with their plants. For example, how to decorate a room with plants or what type of plants can work well in a darker corner of the room. The user will be able to choose if they want a newsletter to their inbox once a week or once a month. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.

- The user will arrive at this page if they sign up to the newsletter, after filling out all the required fields. It is good user experience when they get a result after filling out a form and clicking a button.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add more plants in the future as well as video tutourials on different plant related things.
- I would like to go more in depth on some parts of the care as some details require more work and could use more detailed pictures.

## Testing 

I have tested my code throughout the project as I wanted to check regularly that I was not making mistakes. I have run my HTML through:

- The W3C Markup Validation Service: 

  <details><summary>Home</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/index_check.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Care Station</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/carestation_check.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Newsletter</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/newsletter_check.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Success</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/success_check.png">
  </details>

And I have run my CSS through: 

- The W3C CSS Validation Service:

  <details><summary>CSS</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/style.css_check.png">
  </details>

- I have successfully tested my website on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet Browser.
- I have used Google Chrome Developer Tools through out the creation of my project to test layouts and responsivness as I progressed.
- I have used Google Chrome Developer Tools to test on following devices:
  - iPhone SE
  - iPhone XR
  - iPhone 12 PRO
  - Pixel 5
  - Samsung Galaxy S8+
  - Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
  - iPad Air
  - iPad Mini
  - Surface Pro 7
  - Surface Duo
  - Galaxy Fold
  - Samsung Galaxy A51/71
  - Nest Hub
  - Nest Hub Max

I tested my deployed website with Lighthouse and got the following results on each page:

<details><summary>Home</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/index_lighthouse.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Care Station</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/carestation_lighthouse.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Newsletter</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/newsletter_lighthouse.png">
  </details>
  <details><summary>Success</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/success_lighthouse.png">
  </details>

I believe my performance score was effected by the sizes of my images. I will look into how to better the performance score in the future.

### Unfixed Bugs

- A bug I noticed was that sometimes, after having had Google Chrome Developer Tools open for a while, the website looked like this when developer Tools was closed:

<details><summary>Bug image</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/bug.png">
</details>
<details><summary>Bug image</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/Krnsand/portfolio1_plant_care/blob/main/readme_images/bug1.png">
</details>

It was as if DevTools was still open and set to a certain device screen-size even after it had been closed. If I went to another tab and then returned to my website, the layout had fixed itself, always. I don't understand it and I don't know what to do about it. I will look into it in the future. 

- Another bug (or an interesting special feature perhaps) I found was that some of my style to the Home page did not show up as intended on my own phone. The reason being I have it on "dark mode". Personally I don't mind this "bug" as it doesn't make anything hard to read or messes with the layout or anything else. It just doesn't look as intended. I will look into why it does this in the future, but for now I am enjoying the special effects.

## Deployment

- My website was deployed to GitHub pages. The following steps were used: 
  - In the Github repository of the project find and click the <em>settings</em> symbol  
  - On the left hand side there is a menu, find and click <em>Pages</em>
  - Choose the <em>main</em> branch from the <em>none</em> drop down menu and click save
  - The link to the website needs a couple of minutes to load, then refresh the page and the link will show up at the top of the <em>Pages</em> section with the text "Your site is live at https://krnsand.github.io/portfolio1_plant_care/"
